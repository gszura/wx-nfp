wx-nfp: A free, cross-platform tool to store the observations of menstrual cycle
according to Natural Family Planning rules.

Natural Family Planning (NFP) is a system is a system in which you become aware
of the fertile and infertile times of your menstrual cycle, and you act
accordingly. If you want to avoid pregnancy, you have marital relations only during
the infertile times. If you want to become pregnant, through NFP you know the best
days in each cycle for seeking pregnancy.

wx-nfp is the tool which aims to be a replacement of the paper daily observation
charts. You can store here all your observations and interpret them.

More information can be found on-line (currently mostly in polish, sorry for that ;)
